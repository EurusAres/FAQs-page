                    If you own property that you want to rent, 
                    you should always consider using a property management company or property manager. 
                    These professionals specialize in managing properties and handling tenants, including collecting rent, dealing with clients and leases, and so much more. 
                    It’s a great way to be a landlord with a hands-off approach. Property managers will deal with tenants, renting your property, collecting rent and any deposits, 
                    maintenance and repairs, and total property management for your unit, whether you’ve got one or 100 properties that need to be managed. 
                    You can get back to being a property investor and let someone else handle the details.

                    This is a question that is good to answer because it applies to both property owners and renters alike. 
                    Explain how you screen tenants for rentals, including whether you do background checks, credit checks, or any other special screenings. 
                    You may even offer these on an as-requested basis, so be sure to put that here. Some property owners will want more rigorous screening than others.

                <h3> How much involvement do property owners have? </h3>

                    This is an important question for multiple reasons. 
                    First, it gives you a place to outline your process and explain to people how it works when they choose your property management company. 
                    Secondly, it allows you to offer the opportunity for your owners to tell you how involved they’d like to be, if at all. 
                    If you do totally hands-off management for owners where you just send them the rents and the bills, 
                    make a point of selling that to those who likely have busy lives full of other things that require their attention.

                    This is another big question for property owners. 
                    They typically don’t want to be the one taking the 3 A.M. calls that the furnace is broken when there’s a foot of snow on the ground. 
                    That’s why they chose to go with a property manager in the first place. Explain how you handle maintenance and repairs on the properties that you manage, 
                    including whether you have your own staff or if you outsource to professional repair services, and so forth. 
                    If you have a process for checking with owners to sign off on repairs in advance, or allotting a repair budget, 
                    for example, make sure to explain that here, as well.

                    We know as well as you that there’s no finite timeline on renting properties. 
                    However, owners will want reassurance that you’re doing everything in your power to get their property rented as quickly as possible and to the best tenant that you can find. 
                    Use this opportunity to explain the screening and placement process and help them understand how long it usually takes you to get things done. 
                    Be sure to advise that every case is different, though, so that no one gets upset when things take a little longer. 
                    The goal here is transparent information, even if you can’t give them the exact answers they seek.
